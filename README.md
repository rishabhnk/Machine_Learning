# #100DaysofMLCode

I will be doing 100 days of Machine learning, an hour a day

(I did not start Machine Learning on January 4th, I just started tracking on that day)

### Day 1: Jan 4th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Learned about Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM 
   
   Thoughts: Really fun! I can't wait to do continue tomorrow! 
   
  Basic Git commands to remember:
   ```
   git add . 
   git commit -m "..."
   git push
   git status
   ```

### Day 2: Jan 5th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Learned about Kernel SVM 
   
   Thoughts: Got a lot more complex. Very intersting! (Remembe to make a file with coding necessities)
   
### Day 3: Jan 6th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Finished Kernel SVM and started learning the Naive Bayes Classifier 
   
   Thoughts: This was pretty intersting and I remember learning Bayes Theorem in AP stats so it was pretty easy.

### Day 4: Jan 7th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Finished Naive Bayes Classification and Deicision Tree Classification 
   
   Thoughts: Pretty simple. I have one more classification algorithm left. After that, I will review how to evaluate model performance and then work on the cheat sheet and higher level algorithms.

### Day 5: Jan 8th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Finished Random Forest Classification and started learning how to evaluate classification models performance 
   
   Thoughts: This was a good session. After I finish the evaluating classification models performance, I will review the same section for regression and then go on to either neural networks or clustering.
  
### Day 6: Jan 9th 2019:
   **Applied Learning**- I applied what I have been learning to a new project from DrivenData. I joined the Predict Blood Donations competition and started writing the code.
   
   Thoughts: I knew machine learning would be ab tough and exiting journey but it might be a little tougher than I imagined. I cant wait to finish ...
   
### Day 7: Jan 10th 2019:
   **Applied Learning**- I continued working on my new project from DrivenData. 
   
   Thoughts: I think I am almost done. Tomorrow, I will start the Model Selection & Boosting section in the Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course so I can improve my project.

### Day 8: Jan 11th 2019:
   **Applied Learning**- I started the Model Selecion section and learned about k-fold cross validation and I continued working on my new project from DrivenData- I added k-fold cross validation and made it so we can evaluate the model better by splitting the training data into training and testing sets
   
   Thoughts: I will be able to finish this project once I get through this section in the Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course. Tomorrow, I will continue the course section and work on my project more.

### Day 9: Jan 12th 2019:
   **Learning Model Selection**- I Learned about Model Selection section. Today I focused on Grid Search and also applied it to my DrivenData Project. 
   
   Thoughts: Tomorrow, I will work on my project more and start a new section in the course.
 
### Day 10: Jan 13th 2019:
   **Applying Model Selection**- Today, I improved the Grid Search on my DrivenData Project and improved everything. I also organized my GitHub a bit.
   
   Thoughts: Applying Grid Search to the project was a great idea! I was able to bring the model's accuracy from 76% to 80%. Tomorrow, I will update my GitHub some more and I will start learning about Clustering Algorithms

### Day 11: Jan 14th 2019:
   **Learning Clustering Algorithms**- Today, I started learning about clustering and the K-means algorithms. I also organized my GitHub a bit.
   
   Thoughts: Clustering looks like it will be more complicated than the regression and classification algorithms but it seems really interesting and I am excited to learn what I can do with it. Tomorrow, I will continue learning about K-means and work on my DrivenData project.

### Day 12: Jan 15th 2019:
   **Learning Clustering Algorithms**- Today, I continued learning about clustering and the K-means algorithms.
   
   Thoughts: I learned more about the k-means clustering algorithm and I learned how to decide on the optimal number of clusters and how the method to do so works
   
### Day 13: Jan 16th 2019:
   **Project GDP**- Today, I started working on the GDP Project. The data preprocessing is a little difficult but it is still manageable. Will have the data ready fro implementing the algorithm tomrorow.
   
   Thoughts: There is a lot of work to do, especially with  manipulating the data but I will have it done soon.
   
### Day 14: Jan 17th 2019:
   **Project GDP**- Today, I continued working ont he GDP project. I was able to write a lot of the code today. I included evaluation metrics and grid search and have I am leaning towards using the Random Forest Regression for my model
   
   Thoughts: So far so good. I will finalize my decision on which model to choose based on the evaluation metrics and I will fine tune the model and the code tomorrow
      
### Day 15: Jan 18th 2019:
   **Project GDP**- Today, I worked on the GDP project more. I implemented backwrds elimination and finalized which algorithm I will use as my model
   
   Thoughts: I think I am almost done with this. I hope that the model turnout is accurate and efficient.
   
### Day 16: Jan 19th 2019:
   **Review the Basics**- Today, I reviewed numpy and pandas basics as well as some basic data manipulation.
   
   Thoughts: So far so good. I am going to continue this. In addition to reviewing Python data manipulations, I will also review R data manipulation and learn Convolutional Neural Networks.

### Day 17: Jan 20th 2019:
   **Review the Basics**- Today, I finished reviewing python basics.
   
   Thoughts: I am very confident with python. I am going to do R and CNNs soon

### Day 18: Jan 21th 2019:
   **Review the Basics**- Today, I started my R review. I went over the very basics and started vectors
   
   Thoughts: I am glad that I am reviewing R. I will be done within a week and then I will start CNNs
   
### Day 19: Jan 22th 2019:
   **Review the Basics**- Today, I finished reviewing vectors and matrices for R
   
   Thoughts: So far so good!

### Day 20: Jan 23th 2019:
   **Review the Basics**- Today, I finished reviewing factors for R
   
   Thoughts: So far so good! Next up is dataframes!

### Day 21: Jan 24th 2019:
   **Review the Basics**- Today, I started reviewing dataframes for R
   
   Thoughts: Almost done with dataframes, next is lists!
