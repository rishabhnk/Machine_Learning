# #100DaysofMLCode

I will be doing 100 days of Machine learning, an hour a day

### Jan 4th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM from Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course
   
   Thoughts: Really fun! I can't wait to do continue tomorrow! 
   
  Basic Git commands to remember:
   ```
   git add . 
   git commit -m "..."
   git push
   git status
   ```

### Jan 5th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Kernel SVM from Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course
   
   Thoughts: Got a lot more complex. Very intersting! (Remembe to make a file with coding necessities)
   
### Jan 6th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Finished Kernel SVM and started learning the Naive Bayes Classifier from Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course
   
   Thoughts: This was pretty intersting and I remember learning Bayes Theorem in AP stats so it was pretty easy.

### Jan 7th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Finished Naive Bayes Classification and Deicision Tree Classification from Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course
   
   Thoughts: Pretty simple. I have one more classification algorithm left. After that, I will review how to evaluate model performance and then work on the cheat sheet and higher level algorithms.

### Jan 8th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Finished Random Forest Classification and started learning how to evaluate classification models performance from Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course
   
   Thoughts: This was a good session. After I finish the evaluating classification models performance, I will review the same section for regression and then go on to either neural networks or clustering.
  
### Jan 9th 2019:
   **Applied Learning**- I applied what I have been learning to a new project from DrivenData. I joined the Predict Blood Donations competeition and started writing the code.
   
   Thoughts: I knew machine learning would be ab tough and exiting journey but it might be a little tougher than I imagined. I cant wait to finish ...
   
### Jan 10th 2019:
   **Applied Learning**- I continued working on my new project from DrivenData. 
   
   Thoughts: I think I am almost done. Tomorrow, I will start the Model Selection & Boosting section in the Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course so I can improve my project.

### Jan 11th 2019:
   **Applied Learning**- I started the Model Selecion section and learned about k-fold cross validation and I continued working on my new project from DrivenData- I added k-fold cross validation and made it so we can evaluate the model better by splitting the training data into training and testing sets
   
   Thoughts: I will be able to finish this project once I get through this section in the Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course. Tomorrow, I will continue the course section and work on my project more.
